# Physics Year 3 Functional Minimisation -  A log-likelihood fit for extracting neutrino oscillation parameters

This is the project of the Year 3 elective module of Computational Physics 2023-24 from Imperial College London Physics undergraduate course.


## About the code

### Main modules - the code does all the work

- `main_1d.py` - produces general plots, does 1D minimisation, and examines the methods of uncertainty estimation
- `main_2d.py` - does 2D minimisation, produces final histogram, and performs hypothesis testing
- `main_3d.py` - does 3D minimisation, produces final histogram, and performs hypothesis testing
- `method_comparison.py` - compare all six methods using a known function with path and change of value of each iteration plotted

Noted that the plots shown in the report will be automatically generated by running the relevant main modules (not the method comparison one which is for testing and information only). Other plots can also be produced by changing the relevant boolean variables. Comments were provided in detail for most of the code.

### General functions

- `function.py` - functions for calculating neutrino probability, NLL, and some others for evaluation
- `load_data.py` - functions for read the data
- `minimiser.py` - all minimiser functions are here
- `plot.py` - functions for generating plots
- `uncertainty.py` - functions related to uncertainty calculations

## Folder

The `plots_n_printouts` folder contains the plots shown in report in the relevant folder and also the example outputs in HTML format for the four main modules.
